# What are Lambda Expressions?
Ans.Lambda Expressions, often called lambdas, are a new feature introduced with Java 8. They provide an easier way to work with interfaces that have only got one method, and they are often used in places where the programmer use anonymous classes.

Sometimes we need to write several lines to accomplish what we want to do when all we care about is to print any statement. Using a Lambda expression, we can do that in a single line. Therefore, increasing the program efficiency by reducing the lines of codes.
