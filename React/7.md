## 7. What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScriptX) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. JSX makes it easier to define the structure of your components and provides a more intuitive way to work with React elements.

Example JSX code:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```
