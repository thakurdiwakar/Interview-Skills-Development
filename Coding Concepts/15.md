What is dynamic programming?

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. 
It is a technique used in computer science and mathematics to optimize the solving of problems by avoiding redundant calculations. 
Dynamic programming is particularly useful for problems where the solution can be expressed as the result of smaller overlapping subproblems.

Here are the key characteristics of dynamic programming:

Optimal Substructure: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and the optimal solution to the original 
problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

Overlapping Subproblems: The subproblems occur multiple times during the process of solving the main problem. 
Dynamic programming avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in a data structure (usually an array or table) and 
reusing these results when needed.
