# Describe the Software Development Process in Brief.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a number of fundamental phases that teams must follow in order to produce and deliver high-quality software. Software typically goes through the following phases:

Requirements Gathering: The team identifies, collects, and defines core issues, requirements, requests, and customer expectations related to the software application or service during this stage of the project. Generating software specifications, creating a thorough strategy, documentation, issue tracking, and project or product planning, including allocating the resources, are some tasks done during this phase.
Software Design: The team makes software design decisions regarding the architecture and make of the software solution throughout this design phase of development.
Software Development: Teams develop software solutions based on the design decisions made during earlier stages of the project
Testing and Integration: Software is packaged and tested to ensure quality. Quality assurance, often known as testing, ensures that the solutions deployed fulfil the specified quality and performance criteria.
Deployment: The software is installed in a production setting. The gathered, designed, built, and tested work is shared with the software service's customers and users.
Operation and Maintenance: The software is installed in a production setting. The work is shared with the software service's customers and users.
