## 6. How to render a React component

To render a React component, you need to import it into another component or the main application file and use it like an HTML tag.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a React component: Define your React component, either as a class-based component or a functional component. For example, you can create a component named `MyComponent`.

2. Import the component: In the file where you want to use the component, import it at the top of the file. For example, if `MyComponent` is in a file named `MyComponent.js`, you would import it like this:

   ```jsx
   import MyComponen './MyComponent';
